<p>Prism JS is a well known library for displaying formatted code in the browser. I've never needed to display any code samples on a site I've designed before. When I decided to add a blog section to the site, it became obvious that I needed a good way to showcase some code samples. Enter Prism-JS, a Polymer wrapper for Prism JS that makes code highlighting a cinch. Here's a simple sample:</p>

<prism-js language="javascript" theme="okaidia">
	var Hello = "World!";
</prism-js>

<p>All that's required is a 'prism-js' tag and an attribute indicating the language and theme (if you so choose). Then load all your code inside the tag and you're ready to rock.
